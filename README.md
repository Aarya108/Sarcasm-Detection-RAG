## üöÄ **Overview**  
This project focuses on **sarcasm detection** using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **LangChain**. The model is built to analyze textual input and determine whether it contains sarcasm. Instead of relying solely on pre-trained models, this approach integrates **RAG** to enhance accuracy by leveraging external knowledge sources.  

### üîç **Why Sarcasm Detection?**  
Sarcasm is a complex linguistic phenomenon that poses a challenge for traditional machine learning models. Standard sentiment analysis models often misinterpret sarcastic statements, leading to incorrect results. By integrating **RAG and LangChain**, this project enhances sarcasm detection by incorporating contextual understanding and retrieval-based augmentation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works**  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Processing**  
- We use multiple datasets:  
  - **SARC (Sarcasm Corpus)**  
  - **Twitter Sarcasm Dataset**  
  - **News Headlines Sarcasm Dataset**  
- The data undergoes preprocessing, including text cleaning, tokenization, and embedding generation.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
- RAG improves the model by retrieving relevant information before classification.  
- It helps avoid model hallucinations and enhances the accuracy of sarcasm detection.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **LangChain for Pipeline Optimization**  
- **LangChain** allows easy integration of **LLMs** (Large Language Models) with external data sources.  
- We use **vector databases** for efficient retrieval and dynamic responses.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Choice: Mistral**  
We use **Mistral**, an advanced open-weight LLM, known for its:  
- **Superior performance in reasoning tasks**  
- **Better handling of conversational nuances**  
- **Improved efficiency in inference**

## üìä **Why Use RAG for Sarcasm Detection?**  
Traditional NLP models **struggle with sarcasm** due to its context-dependent nature. RAG helps by:  
‚úÖ Retrieving **related context** before making predictions.  
‚úÖ Reducing **hallucination** by incorporating factual information.  
‚úÖ Improving **explainability** of predictions.  

### **Why LangChain?**  
LangChain simplifies the integration of **LLMs**, vector stores, and retrieval models, making the pipeline **modular, scalable, and efficient**.

## üìà **Performance & Accuracy**  
- **Mistral + RAG** outperforms traditional sarcasm detection models.  
- The model achieves high accuracy due to **contextual retrieval** before classification.
